### Heat Distribution Problem
The heat distribution problem is an important study in science/engineering and plays a key role in climate modeling and weather forecasting. The two-dimensional (2D) heat distribution problem is to find the steady state temperature distribution within an area which has known fixed temperatures along each of its edges.
